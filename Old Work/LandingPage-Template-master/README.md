# SomeOrdinaryBro's Dashboard
This is a landing page / dashboard created using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in frontend development and to serve as a template for future projects.

As a beginner in full-stack development, I am currently going through the Odin Project curriculum and learning new things along the way. As I progress, I will continue to update this site with new features and improvements.
